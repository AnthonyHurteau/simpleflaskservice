# simpleflaskservice

This repo provides a simple Python-Flask Server with several RESTful APIs for learning and testing. I created it to learn about running containers within Pods in Kubernetes, but it has many more applications than "just" testing in clustered environments. Deployed on a virtual machine, or baremetal, it could be a useful tool demonstrating HTTP connectivity.  

The current release of this code is also available as a containerized image on https://hub.docker.io/.  

Alternatively, this code can easily be transformed into a docker image following the steps included in this repo.  

## How to transform this code into a Docker Image

0. Install docker and have it working to the point where you can launch containers. Instructions to do this are outside the scope of this README.md, but refer to https://docker.io for instructions on getting up and running.

0. git clone the repository to your local machine.
